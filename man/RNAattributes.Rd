\title{Overlap genome annotation file information with sRNA/mRNA-seq data}
\usage{
RNAattributes(data, annotation, input = c("sRNA", "mRNA"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame; containing rows of potential dicer-derived clusters
including columns which supply the genomic coordinates, where \code{chr} supplies
the chromosome number, \code{start} and \code{end} which supply the coordinates.}

\item{annotation}{A path, URL, connection or GFFFile object. A genome
reference annotation file (.gff/.gff1/.gff2/.gff3).}
}
\value{
Adds an additional columns from GFF containing information which
overlaps any sRNA cluster loci. These columns represent the standard columns
in a GFF file.
}
\description{
Based on genomic coordinates, assign sRNA clusters with an annotation that
has an exact match based on chromosome number, start and end coordinates
}
\details{
The function merges an annotation (.gff/.gff3) file with
the sRNA data set based on the chromosome, start and end coordinates. It is
important that any alteration which were made to the genome reference
(FASTA), such as alterations to the chromosome name, must be carried forth
to the genome annotation file. If alterations were made to the reference
genome using the \code{\link[=RNAmergeGenomes]{RNAmergeGenomes()}} function, alteration
inline with these can be accomplished using the
\code{\link[=RNAmergeAnnotations]{RNAmergeAnnotations()}} function.
