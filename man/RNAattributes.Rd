\title{Identify specific attributes associated to a sRNA cluster}
\usage{
RNAattributes(data, annotation)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame; containing rows of potential dicer-derived clusters
including columns which supply the genomic coordinates, where `chr` supplies the
chromosome number, `start` and `end` which supply the coordinates.}

\item{annotation}{A path, URL, connection or GFFFile object. A genome
reference annotation file (.gff/.gff1/.gff2/.gff3).}
}
\description{
Based on genomic coordinates, assign sRNA clusters with an annotation that
has an exact match based on chromosome number, start and end coordinates
}
\details{
The function merges an annotation (.gff/.gff3) file with
the sRNA data set based on the chromosome, start and end coordinates. It is
important that any alteration which were made to the genome reference (FASTA), such
as alterations to the chromosome name, must be carried forth to the
genome annotation file. If alterations were made to the reference genome
using the [mobileRNA::RNAmergeGenomes()] function, alteration inline with
these can be accomplished using the [mobileRNA::RNAmergeAnnotations()]
function.
