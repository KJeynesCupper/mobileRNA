\title{PCA plot to illustrate sample distance.}
\usage{
plotSamplePCA(data, group, vst = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{class data.frame; data set containing the raw data produced as
output from [RNAlocate::RNAconsensus()] and/or [RNAlocate::RNAsubset()].}

\item{group}{character vector; contains experimental conditions for each
replicate. IMPORTANT: Ensure this is in the same order as the replicates are
found in the data frame supplied to the `data` argument (from left to right).}

\item{vst}{logical; Variance stabilizing transformation. By default, the
function uses a regularized log transformation on the data set, however, this
will not suit all experimental designs.}
}
\value{
A PCA plot to show sample distance.
}
\description{
A function to draw a principal component analysis (PCA) plot.
 The function undertakes rlog transformation of the data in
 an unbiased manner (\code{blind=TRUE}).
}
\details{
This function utilises the DESeq2 package to organise and plot the
data. It organises the data into a DESeqDataSet which undergoes log
transformation where the results are used to undertake the PCA analysis. The
results are plotted against the principle components 1 and 2.

In special conditions, regularized log transformation will not suit
the experimental design. For example, an experimental design without
replicates. In this instance, it is preferable to change the default setting
and switch to a variance stabilizing transformation method (\code{`vst=TRUE`}).
