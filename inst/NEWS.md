# mobileRNA 1.0.13

* Updates citation 

# mobileRNA 1.0.12

* Updated RNAfeatures and plotRNAfeatures including new parameters to
control plotting and representation of genomic features. 
* Updated citation 

# mobileRNA 1.0.11

* Major updated to RNAfeatures. Instead identifies features independently for 
the genome annotation rather than using preset features.  

# mobileRNA 1.0.1

* Version bump following Bioconductor updates.
* Improved the RNAfeatures function due discrepancies. Previously, calculated 
width rather than relative number of features. 
* Improved RNAdistribution function, including fixing a small bug, replaced 
depreciated functioned and improved aesthetic and code structure. 
* Introduced new plotting function plotRNAfeatures.

# mobileRNA 0.99.19

* Missing connective in RNAfeatures when using repeats variable.
* Added additional check for RNAsequences methods. 

# mobileRNA 0.99.17

* Corrected ORCID references for authors 


# mobileRNA 0.99.17

* Amended `RNAmobile()` to ensure removal of non-zero values 
* Improved look of PCA plot 
* Corrected documentation issue and code disparage in `plotHeatmap()`, and improved styling. 
* Included calculation of consensus sequence determination option for `RNAsequence()`


# mobileRNA 0.99.15

# mobileRNA 0.99.14
## Previous changes

* Removed unnecessary man files for GFF and FASTA files on remote repo
* Fixed bug in `RNAdistribution()` plot, when sample specific
* Broadened use of `RNAattributes()` function. 
* Updated vignette
* Updated `RNAdicercall()` to allow any dicer-classification (not constricted to 20-24)
* Converted cat() to message() for user information from functions 
* Amended example data 
* Amended CITATION and NEWs file
