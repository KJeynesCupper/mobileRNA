- selfgraft_mRNAdemo_1.fq is a demo mRNAseq FASTQ file for a self-graft control 
  Eggplant (Solanum melongena). The original bioloigcal data file was taken from 
  the study Villanueva, G., Vilanova, S., Plazas, M., Prohens, J., & Gramazio, 
  P. (2023). Transcriptome profiles of eggplant (Solanum melongena) and its wild
  relative S. dasyphyllum under different levels of osmotic stress provide 
  insights into response mechanisms to drought. Current Plant Biology, 33, 
  100276. Accession number SRR10060529. This file was reduced in size to support 
  the workflow. 

- selfgraft_mRNAdemo_2.fq is a demo mRNAseq FASTQ file for a self-graft control

  the workflow. 

- heterograft_mRNAdemo_1.fq is a demo simulated mRNAseq FASTQ file for a 
  heterograft, similuating an Eggplant (Solanum melongena) scion and Tomato 
  (Solanum lycopersicum) rootstock. The original bioloigcal data for Eggplant 
  was taken from the study Villanueva, G., Vilanova, S., Plazas, M., Prohens, 
  J., & Gramazio, P. (2023). Transcriptome profiles of eggplant 
  (Solanum melongena) and its wild relative S. dasyphyllum 
  under different levels of osmotic stress provide insights into response 
  mechanisms to drought. Current Plant Biology, 33, 100276. Accession 
  number SRR10060529. The bioloigcal data for Tomato was taken from Tomato 
  Genome Consortium, X. (2012). The tomato genome sequence provides insights 
  into fleshy fruit evolution. Nature, 485(7400), 635. Accession number 
  SRR404309. This file was reduced in size to support the workflow.
