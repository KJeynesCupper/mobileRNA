Description: Genomic analysis can be utilised to identify differences between RNA 
  populations in two conditions, both in production and abundance. This includes 
  the identification of RNAs produced by multiple genomes within a biological 
  system. For example, RNA produced by pathogens within a host or mobile RNAs in
  plant graft systems. The mobileRNA package provides methods to pre-process, 
  analyse and visualise the sRNA and mRNA populations based on the premise of
  mapping reads to all genotypes at the same time.
